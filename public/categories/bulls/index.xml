      <description>Since taking over for Fred Hoiberg at the beginning of December, Jim Boylen has taken a ton of criticism for his approach as the new lead man for the Bulls, but rightfully so. His “play hard” mentality and push to be the best conditioned team in the league (defending push-up champs) hasn’t resonated with players of this era. Not only is this management style not fitting well, his philosophy as a coach doesn’t fit the mold of how the league has trended with a barrage of three point attempts coming per game.</description>

      <description> EXAMPLE POST
Rose: &amp;quot;I’m happy I didn’t change throughout this whole process. I remained myself. I stayed true to my family. There was a lot of people that jumped off the boat when I was going through things. I seen who they were. I know what’s fake love and what’s real love.&amp;quot;
