#### **About the Blog**

As a Chicago kid growing up on the south side, I've learned to become passionate about our sports team as I've been cheering on the White Sox and Bulls for as long as I can remember (my football allegiance belongs to those cheeseheads to the north which can be discussed another day). In recent years, we've seen our favorite sports evolve based on data and analytics. Organizations are now relying on data for decisions around personnel, in-game strategy, and salary cap management among others. The emergence of data-related trends within sports and the concept of open sourced tools has led to a plethora of data to be analyzed. As a professional advancing in the field of data science, I've embraced this evolation and found myself wanting to work more with data I enjoy, pushing me to create this blog. 

The blog is intended to focus on data and analytics primarily for Chicago-based sports teams. As a fan primarily of football, basketball, and baseball, I will focus on insights and information for the Bulls, White Sox, Cubs, and Bears. What might this be exactly? Well, it can really be any type of question you can formulate.

The Big Oxmox advised her not to do so, because there were thousands of bad Commas, wild Question Marks and devious Semikoli, but the Little Blind Text didn't listen. She packed her seven versalia, put her initial into the belt and made herself on the way.
