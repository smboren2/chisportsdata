### **Why start a blog?**

As a Chicago kid growing up on the south side, I’ve learned to become passionate about our sports team as I’ve been cheering on the White Sox and Bulls for as long as I can remember (my football allegiance belongs to those cheeseheads to the north which can be discussed another day). In recent years, we’ve seen our favorite sports continue to evolve on the basis of data and analytics. Organizations have become more reliant on data for personnel, in-game strategy, and salary cap decisions, among others. The continued emergence of data-related trends within sports and the concept of open sourced software has made data much easier to access giving opportunity to fans and data scientists alike to analyze and research the sports we love at a deeper level. The availability of data, my passion for sports, and the need to continually educate myself in the data science field pushed me toward creating this blog.

### **What can you expect?**

Blogs can generally be about anything. The focus here is to educate readers, presumably Chicago sports fans, about their teams through a data-centric lens in the most interpretable way possible. Each post will typically center on a specific question (i.e. How have the Bulls performed under Jim Boylen vs. Fred Hoiberg?) using advanced analytics and data visualizations to potentially reach a conclusion. In true data science fashion, each analysis related to a post will reproducible and made available on Github using R and RMarkdown.
