<p>Since taking over for Fred Hoiberg at the beginning of December, Jim Boylen has taken a ton of criticism for his approach as the new lead man for the Bulls, but rightfully so. His “play hard” mentality and push to be the best conditioned team in the league (defending push-up champs) hasn’t resonated with players of this era. Not only is this management style not fitting well, his philosophy as a coach doesn’t fit the mold of how the league has trended with a barrage of three point attempts coming per game. While this is rather easy to see now after 24 games, I initially wanted to reserve any judgement on the new coach and see how the team would perform and if the young core would develop. Well, after a 20 point drubbing from the rebuilding Atlanta Hawks at home, I think it’s safe to say the team has some work to do. Not only do we not see any cohesiveness from the team on the court, but we are starting to sense some divide amongst the players and the direction their coach is taking them.</p>

<p>Now that Boylen has matched the number of games Hoiberg has coached this year, let’s see how the team has transformed.</p>

<h3>Shot Selection</h3>
<p>There’s a reason we’ve seen the three point shot become the focal point for most teams: analytics. It really is simple math, but the evolution of analytics in sports has made front offices realize that attempting more three-pointers will increase your expected point total. Well, since drill sergeant Boylen took over, the Bulls have consistently taken less threes.</p>

<p>On average across the league, the 3-point shot represents 35% of teams’ field goal attempts. The Bulls are consistently below that when looking across a 5-game average and hit peak “Boyball” at the end of December into early January. Only recently are we seeing the team begin to take more 3-pointers which is likely due to a little talking to from the front office.</p>
