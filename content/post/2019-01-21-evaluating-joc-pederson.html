<p>With rumblings about a potential trade for Joc Pederson, the White Sox are continuing to remain active this offseason, although we are all waiting for that one <strong>BIG</strong> signing to occur still. If you’re active on Twitter, you’ll notice a lot of your favorite White Sox accounts would tell you that Pederson would have ranked 1st in almost every statistical category for the White Sox last season. Let’s take a look at some of the numbers and see if we can pinpoint what Joc Pederson brings to the table for the South Siders.</p>
<div id="what-we-know" class="section level1">
<h1>What we know</h1>
<p>Joc made his major league debut at the end of 2014 for the Dodgers at age 22 and although he for a 0.210 average in 2015, the outfielder was selected to his first All-Star game.</p>
</div>
<div id="the-good" class="section level1">
<h1>The Good</h1>
<p>Of 178 qualified hitters that averaged over 400 plate appearances since 2015, Pederson has a wOBA better than 124 players, or about 70.0% of the field.</p>

<p>As others have mentioned, he’s ranked 1st in most categories if he were part of the forgettable 2018 White Sox. His 0.354 wOBA in 2018 is a fair number better than the best performing Sox players. Of those with at least 400 plate appearances in 2018, here’s how they faired. If this were Twitter, I’d have to add a #108ing #Palkasmash.</p>

<p>In addition to wOBA, here’s a list of categories Joc would’ve ranked first in for the 2018 White Sox:</p>
<ul>
<li>WAR</li>
<li>OPS</li>
<li>SLG</li>
<li>Walk to Strikeout Ratio</li>
<li>ISO</li>
<li>K Rate</li>
